## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->

The time has come  
The walrus said  
To speak of many things  

Of shoes and ships  
and sealing wax  
of cabbages and kings

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem you created using chatGPT of 20 to 30 lines,here!-->

In chambers dim where shadows play their part,  
A soul, enshrined in thought, doth ponder deep.  
Through labyrinthine corridors of heart,  
It wanders, seeking solace in its keep.  

Oh, doth this mortal coil confound the mind,  
With questions vast as oceans, dark and wide.  
Yet in the murmur of the whispered wind,  
A glimpse of truth, elusive, doth abide.  

For who can fathom love's enigmatic grace,  
Or chart the course of destiny's decree?  
In trembling hands, we hold the fragile vase,  
And drink the bitter dregs of destiny.  

So let us seize the moment, fleeting, brief,  
And dance amidst the stars that light our way.  
For in the end, it matters not the grief,  
But how we lived, and loved, from day to day.  
 
Thus let us raise our voices to the sky,  
And toast the mysteries that lie ahead.  
For though we live, we know not when we die,  
We'll journey on, where'er our souls are led.
