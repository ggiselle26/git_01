## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->

The time has come  
The walrus said  
To speak of many things  

Of shoes and ships  
and sealing wax  
of cabbages and kings  

## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,  
And sorry I could not travel both  
And be one traveler, long I stood  
And looked down one as far as I could  
To where it bent in the undergrowth;  



## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->

"The sun was shining on the sea,  
      Shining with all his might:  
He did his very best to make  
      The billows smooth and bright —  
And this was odd, because it was  
      The middle of the night.  

The moon was shining sulkily,  
      Because she thought the sun  
Had got no business to be there  
      After the day was done —  
"It's very rude of him," she said,  
      "To come and spoil the fun."  


## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem you created using chatGPT of 20 to 30 lines,here!-->

In chambers dim where shadows play their part,  
A soul, enshrined in thought, doth ponder deep.  
Through labyrinthine corridors of heart,  
It wanders, seeking solace in its keep.  

Oh, doth this mortal coil confound the mind,  
With questions vast as oceans, dark and wide.  
Yet in the murmur of the whispered wind,  
A glimpse of truth, elusive, doth abide.  

For who can fathom love's enigmatic grace,  
Or chart the course of destiny's decree?  
In trembling hands, we hold the fragile vase,  
And drink the bitter dregs of destiny.  

So let us seize the moment, fleeting, brief,  
And dance amidst the stars that light our way.  
For in the end, it matters not the grief,  
But how we lived, and loved, from day to day.  
 
Thus let us raise our voices to the sky,  
And toast the mysteries that lie ahead.  
For though we live, we know not when we die,  
We'll journey on, where'er our souls are led.
